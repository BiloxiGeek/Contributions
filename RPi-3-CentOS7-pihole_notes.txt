Pull the SD card adapter, reinsert to get the SD card mounted again

I do a few tweaks on the card before I put it in the RPi3
- set up /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
- Copy /etc/ssh/ from the other running SD card so I don't have to fight the known_hosts file (check file permissions are correct on the keys)
- Copy root entry in the running RPi's /etc/shadow to get the password changed
- Disable selinux (figure we can fight that battle later)
- Disable firewalld (just my preference at the moment)
- Expand the root filesystem in gparted to 10240, takes care of partitioning and resize2fs steps 
- created another partition just for laughs and chuckles
- umount everything and move the SD card to the RPi

Boot fresh SD card
- Install vim (my preference)
- mkdir -p /export/source
- Edit /etc/fstab to mount /dev/mmcblk0p4 on /export/source
- yum install wget
- cd /export/source
- wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/SRPMS/l/lighttpd-1.4.39-3.el7.src.rpm

- yum install rpm-build
- yum install gcc make
- mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
- echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
- rpm -ivh /export/source/lighttpd-1.4.39-3.el7.src.rpm

- Already installed at this point:
  -- newt dnsmasq curl unzip wget findutils
  -- cronie sudo (get updated) 
- yum install iproute bc bind-utils git nmap-ncat php php-cli php-common
- cd /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/armv7hl

  spawn-fcgi-1.6.3-5.el7.centos.armv7hl.rpm
- Ran a yum update at this point, powered off, pulled the SD card and plugged it back into my Fedora desktop so I could copy an image of the root partition.
- Started up the RPi again
- curl -L https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
